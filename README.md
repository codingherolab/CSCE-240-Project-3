Project Description
Each of the header files contains a description of the problem you are tasked to solve, along with point
allocation. The makefile contains rules to build each of the problems’ final test executable. The makefile
also contains rules to run cpplint on the files for style point assessment.
Do note this is an exam. If you ask questions which can be answered by reading the test files or the
project files, I will refer you to those. Questions about strategy or syntax cannot be answered. Asking
questions about homework which happen to also answer questions about the exam cannot be answered.
Given that this is your final exam, late submissions are not accepted.
Target Environment
Make sure that your code runs in the target environment. As always, you may develop and test your code
in your environment of choice. However, code which does not run in the test environment will not be considered. Ensure that you do not hardcode paths into your environment. This is unnecessary because the
makefile appends the root exam3 directory to the compiler’s include path.
Academic Integrity
This is an exam. Requesting help from others is cheating. Working together is cheating. Discussing the
problems is cheating. This is a test of your skills and so you are to solve the questions on your own, using
only reference materials.
You will notice that there is more ambiguity in this exam. More of the classes’ declaration and definition is left to your discretion. That is intentional. For this exam, any submissions found to be too
similar will be turned into the Office of Academic Integrity. Those submissions’ grades will be held until
the investigation is complete. The penalty for submitting work found to be in violation of the Academic
Integrity code is a -100%.
